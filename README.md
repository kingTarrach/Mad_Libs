# Mad_Libs
Implements Mad Libs in Python. Future plans to add more Mad Libs and implement in HTML/JS

Stay with current naming conventions. 

To add a Mad Lib do the following steps:

1a. Implement the sentence chunks in a unique list of strings in sentences.py
1b. Implement the prompts in a unique list of strings in prompts.py
1c. (Optional) For words that are not obvious on the spot, provide a new definition in definitions.py
2a. Update returnSentence function to return sentence chunks given the next input
2b. Update match in menu function to be one of the choices in the match with corresponding sentence chunks and prompts
3. Add the new Mad Lib into the Mad_libs list in mad_libs.py
